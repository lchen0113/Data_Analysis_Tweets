# Data_Analysis_Tweets
Submission for a code challenge whose target is to analyze the community Twitter users. The program has two features:
1. Clean and extract the text from the raw JSON tweets that come from the Twitter Streaming API, and track the number of tweets that contain unicode.
2. Calculate the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears.
